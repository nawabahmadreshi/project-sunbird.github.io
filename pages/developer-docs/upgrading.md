## Overview

Upgrading to the latest version of Sunbird allows you to avail benefits of new and enhanced features and ensures that bugs are fixed on the platform as well the latest updated versions of any third party component used by it.  

* From release-1.5:
	
	- All the services are maintained with same image gold version 
	- Cassandra migration is introduced to update cassandra database schema.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python installed on the Cassandra machine

## Upgrading Sunbird Services 

1. Pull the latest code of `project-sunbird/sunbird-devops` from the master branch.
 
2. It is recommended to take a full backup of all the databases before updating the schema 

Follow the steps [here](developer-docs/installation/medium_scale_deploy/#taking-a-back-up-of-database-servers) to take the backup 

3. Run the following command `./sunbird-install.sh`


**Note:** 

- Executing the command will deploy the latest version of Sunbird services and also update the latest schema in databases

- Latest image versions of all the services are updated in the master branch. To get any particular hotfix image of any Sunbird service, update the minor version in the `sunbird-devops/deploy/deploy-core.sh` file and re-run the `sunbird-devops/deploy/deploy-core.sh` script.


## Backup the Databases

1. SSH to the database server where you want to store your backup

2. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops`

3. cd `sunbird-devops/deploy/`

### Backup Cassandra

Ensure that the prerequisites are met and follow the steps to backup Cassandra database: 

**Backup:** 
	
1. Take a snapshot of Cassandara database using the following command  
	
   `nodetool snapshot -t my_backup`
   
2. Copy the snapshot to your backup directory
    
   `./cassandra_backup.py <cassandra_data_path> <snapshot_name> <path_to_backup_directory>`

      For example:

    `./cassandra_backup.py  /var/lib/cassandra/data my_backup  cassandra_backup_20180412`
		
 **Note:** Executing the command creates the snapshots of all the keyspaces as:  
		
		a) portal         -  Stores the session data
		b) dialcodes      -  Stores the energized text book details
		c) sunbirdplugin  -  Stores the custom or plugin data(used in announcement feature (Object API)
		d) sunbird	  -  Stores the organization ,user, course, batch, badger etc.
		

**Restore Cassandra**

1. Copy the Cassandra backup snapshot to the instance where you want to run restore.

2. Restore Cassandra database using command
	           
   `./cassandra_restore.py <cassandra_host_ip_address> <snapshotdir>`
      
  for example: 

   `./cassandra_restore.py 10.10.10.10 ./cassandra_bakup_20180412`
